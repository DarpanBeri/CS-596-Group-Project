For the road to riches and diamond rings. . We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us. . We trying to buy back our 40 acres. . And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop. . Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe. . I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em. . We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom. . We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em. . Things we buy to cover up what's inside. . Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth. . That's why shortys hollering \"where the ballas' at?\". . Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack. . And a white man get paid off of all of that. . But I ain't even gon act holier than thou. . Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou. . Before I had a house and I'd do it again. . Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz. . I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific. . I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific. . I got a problem with spending before I get it. . We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it.</td>\n",

GET 'EM HIGH. All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man. GET 'EM HIGH. Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands. KEEP 'EM HIGH. And if your losing your high then* smoke again. KEEP 'EM HIGH. Now, my flow. Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics. I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics. My freshman year I was going through hella problems. 'til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college. My teacher said I'm a loser, I told her why don't you kill me. I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow my heart,. And if you follow the charts, or the plaques or the stacks. You ain't gotta guess who's back,. You see I'm so Chi that you thought it was bashful. But this bastard's flow will bash a skull. And I will cut your girl like Pastor Troy. And I don't usually smoke but pass the 'dro. And I won't give you that money that you asking for. Why you think me and Dame cool? We're assholes!. That's why we hear your music in fast forward. 'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more. Now who the hell is this?. E-mailing me at 11:26, telling me that she 36-26, plus double D. You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubbly. At NYU but she hail from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chilling on campus. Sent me a picture with her feeling on Candice. Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis. W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet. So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend. His name Kweli. (You mean Talib, lyrics stick to your rib). I mean. (That's my favorite CD that I play in my crib). I mean. (You don't really know him, why is you lying). You Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line. She's gonna think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines. Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high. Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes. But never mind, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out. And my rhymes is finna blow you trying to blow backs out. Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, aiyyo. Ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your mom?. She's the bomb, but she got the boujee behavior. Always got something to say like an OK player hater. Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet. Or chicks on Birth Control stuck to they arm like Nicorette. You really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes. And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet. I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate. I got the bubble kush and a sister could get a hit of it. Get 'em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke. A high filled with dope. You all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes. The real nigga quotes. Real rappers is hard to find like a remote control,. Rap is not a used to but still got love,. That's why I abuse you who are not thugs. Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show. Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggas in you. You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you. How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead. I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is too sexy to even make songs like these. That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys. Too many featured MCs, and producers is popular. Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her. Album, how come, you the hot garbage of. The year, It's clear your image is snooped up. Label got you souped up, telling you you're sick. Man you a dick with a loose nut. Video hard to watch like Medusa. Even your club record need a booster. Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga. Read the infa, red across your head Imma bred King like Simba. Boulder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a MC with a temper. You dancing for money like honey, I did this my way. So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye. Spitting through wires and fires, MCs retiring. Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then.</td>\n",

There's too much stuff on my heart right now man. I'll gladly risk it all right now. It's a life or death situation man. Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man. It's your boy Kanye to the.... Chi-Town what's going on. I drink a boost for breakfast, and ensure for dessert. Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp.

And just imagine how my girl feel. On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till. She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine. She a delta so she been throwing them Dynasty signs. No use me tryin' to be lyin'. I been trying to be signed. Trying to be a millionaire. How I use two lifelines. In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died. The doctor said I had blood clots. But I ain't Jamaican man. Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band. I swear this right here is history in the making man. I really apologize how I sound right now man. If it's unclear at all, man. They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks. You know we had reconstru.... I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw. Looked in the mirror half my jaw was in the back of my mouth man. I couldn't believe it. But I'm still here for you all right now yo. This is what I gotta say yo. Yeah, turn me up yeah. What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around. But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word. Except he's really putting it down. And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory. And what we need to do in the game. Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time. In the blink of an eye his whole life changed. If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mace felt. Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt. I swear to God driver two wanna sue. I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe; safe. My dawgs couldn't tell if I. I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised. There's been an accident like GEICO. They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael. I must gotta angel. Cause look how death missed his ass. Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass. Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past. Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash. And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid. Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did. But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph. Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire. Know what I'm saying. When the doctor told me I had a um..  I was going to have a plate on my chin. I said dawg don't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now. Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on.

Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone. We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?. So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2. Timbuck2, Timbuck2. Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are. (Perfect!).</td>\n",

       "      <td>. . . . . Yeah, 9: 08 L.A. time. Back in the lab and shit. My wife said, I can't say no to nobody. And at this rate we gon' both die broke. Got friends that ask me for money knowing I'm in debt. And like my wife said, I still didn't say no. People tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter. My friends best advice was to stay low. I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills. Especially when you got family members on payroll. The media said it was outlandish spending. The media said he's way out of control. I just feel like I'm the only one not pretending. I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control. I know I'm the most influential. That TIME cover was just confirmation. This generation's closest thing to Einstein. So don't worry about me, I'm fine. I can see a thousand years from now in real life. Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like. Grow conventional thought, don't need to question. I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive. Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission. Did it with no permission, on our own conditions. Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission. Yeezy with the big house, did it way different. Never listen to Hollywood producers. Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa. The ultimate Gemini has survived. I wasn't supposed to make it past 25. And you're looking at the church in the night sky. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. Are we looking in the church in the night sky. And you wonder where is God in your nightlife. Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky. Father, father, father. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. The night sky, I feel like I'm home, baby. I've been waking the spirits of millions more to come. A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums. I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro. If the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho. Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation. He sat back and smiled. Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime. The Jews share they truth on how to make a dime. Most black men couldn't balance a cheque-book. But buy a new car, talking 'bout how my neck look?. Well it all looks great. Four hundred years later, we buying our own chains. The light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard. Real family stick together and see through the mirage. The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality. Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?. I am one with the people. I am one with the people, real. I've awoken from an enlightened man's dream. Checking Instagram comments to crowd-source my self-esteem. Let me not say too much or do too much. Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch. I'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen. So the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping. God, I have humbled myself before the court. Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort. I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams. One set of footsteps, you was carrying me. When I turned on the news and they was burying me. One set of footsteps, you was carrying me. When I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me. Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see. I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov. I heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove. But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks. Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'mma never go broke. Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go. We all go. Not just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo. She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo. Modern day MJ with an off-the-wall flow. Nightlife, walk all over me. Walk all over me. I'm delivering everything I've ever sent to you, bring. Fly, fly, fly overseas. Fly overseas. Oh, anywhere, everything but in between. Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. Oh, you're looking in the church in the night sky. And you wonder where is God in your nightlife. Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky. And you wonder where is God in your nightlife. Please face me when I speak. Please say to me something before you leave. You've been treating me like I'm invisible. Now I'm visible to you, oh, the invisible truths. Stay sober. I don't quite understand the games you play. Understand, understand. Understand I'm standing under oath. And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore. While I'm crying at the bar. I'm wishing that you saw my scars, man. I'm wishing that you came down here. And stood by me. And look at me like you knew me. But I feel so alone. Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above. And you're looking at the church in the night sky. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. Are we looking at the church in the night sky?. And you wonder where is God in your nightlife. Yeah, you're looking at the ch...</td>\n",

Yo, we at war. We at war with terrorism, racism, and most of all we at war with ourselves. (Jesus walks). God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down. (Jesus walks with me) with me, with me, with me . You know what the Midwest is?. Young & Restless. Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace. And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus. Somebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is. I walk through the valley of the shadow of death is. Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless Uhhhh!. Try to catch it Uhhhh! It's kinda hard. Getting choked by the detectives yeah yeah now check the method. They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us. Saying, \"We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast.\". Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?. We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases. A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis. My mamma used to say only Jesus can save us. Well mamma I know I act a fool. But I'll be gone 'til November I got packs to move I Hope. (Jesus walks). God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down. (Jesus walks with me). The only thing that that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now. (Jesus walks). And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs. (Jesus walks with me). I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long. To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers. (Jesus walks with them). To the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah. (Jesus walks with them). Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly. I know he hear me when my feet get weary. Cause we're the almost nearly extinct. We rappers are role models we rap we don't think. I ain't here to argue about his facial features. Or here to convert atheists into believers. I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers. The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus. So here go my single dog radio needs this. They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus. That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes. But if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh?. Well if this take away from my spins. Which will probably take away from my ends. Then I hope this take away from my sins. And bring the day that I'm dreaming about. Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out. (Jesus walks). God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down. (Jesus walks). The only thing that that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now. (Jesus walks). And I don't thing there's nothing I can do now to right my wrongs. (Jesus walks with me... fades). I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long.    \n",

I'm trying to catch the beat, uh. I'm trying to catch the beat. I'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh. I'm trying to catch the beat. Now, throw your motherfucking hands. GET 'EM HIGH. All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man. GET 'EM HIGH. Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands. KEEP 'EM HIGH. And if your losing your high then* smoke again. KEEP 'EM HIGH. Now, my flow. Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics. I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics. My freshman year I was going through hella problems. 'til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college. My teacher said I'm a loser, I told her why don't you kill me. I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow my heart,. And if you follow the charts, or the plaques or the stacks. You ain't gotta guess who's back,. You see I'm so Chi that you thought it was bashful. But this bastard's flow will bash a skull. And I will cut your girl like Pastor Troy. And I don't usually smoke but pass the 'dro. And I won't give you that money that you asking for. Why you think me and Dame cool? We're assholes!. That's why we hear your music in fast forward. 'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more. Now who the hell is this?. E-mailing me at 11:26, telling me that she 36-26, plus double D. You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubbly. At NYU but she hail from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chilling on campus. Sent me a picture with her feeling on Candice. Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis. W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet. So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend. His name Kweli. (You mean Talib, lyrics stick to your rib). I mean. (That's my favorite CD that I play in my crib). I mean. (You don't really know him, why is you lying). You Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line. She's gonna think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines. Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high. Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes. But never mind, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out. And my rhymes is finna blow you trying to blow backs out. Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, aiyyo. Ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your mom?. She's the bomb, but she got the boujee behavior. Always got something to say like an OK player hater. Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet. Or chicks on Birth Control stuck to they arm like Nicorette. You really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes. And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet. I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate. I got the bubble kush and a sister could get a hit of it. Get 'em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke. A high filled with dope. You all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes. The real nigga quotes. Real rappers is hard to find like a remote control,. Rap is not a used to but still got love,. That's why I abuse you who are not thugs. Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show. Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggas in you. You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you. How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead. I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is too sexy to even make songs like these. That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys. Too many featured MCs, and producers is popular. Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her. Album, how come, you the hot garbage of. The year, It's clear your image is snooped up. Label got you souped up, telling you you're sick. Man you a dick with a loose nut. Video hard to watch like Medusa. Even your club record need a booster. Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga. Read the infa, red across your head Imma bred King like Simba.

Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?. Can they, huh?. Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall. For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all. Through the fire, through whatever come what may. For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all away. Right down through the wire, even through the fire. I spit it through the wire man. There's too much stuff on my heart right now man. I'll gladly risk it all right now. It's a life or death situation man. Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man. It's your boy Kanye to the.... Chi-Town what's going on. I drink a boost for breakfast, and ensure for dessert. Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp. That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk. Not to worry Mr. H 2 the Izzo's back to wizzerk. How do you console my mom or give her light support?. Telling her your son's on life support. And just imagine how my girl feel. On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till. She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine. She a delta so she been throwing them Dynasty signs. No use me tryin' to be lyin'. I been trying to be signed. Trying to be a millionaire. How I use two lifelines. In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died. The doctor said I had blood clots. But I ain't Jamaican man. Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band. I swear this right here is history in the making man. I really apologize how I sound right now man. If it's unclear at all, man. They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks. You know we had reconstru.... I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw. Looked in the mirror half my jaw was in the back of my mouth man. I couldn't believe it. But I'm still here for you all right now yo. This is what I gotta say yo. Yeah, turn me up yeah. What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around. But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word. Except he's really putting it down. And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory. And what we need to do in the game. Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time. In the blink of an eye his whole life changed. If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mace felt. Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt. I swear to God driver two wanna sue. I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe; safe. My dawgs couldn't tell if I. I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised. There's been an accident like GEICO. They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael. I must gotta angel. Cause look how death missed his ass. Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass. Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past. Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash. And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid. Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did. But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph. Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire. Know what I'm saying. When the doctor told me I had a um..  I was going to have a plate on my chin. I said dawg don't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now. Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on. Can't be serious man.    \n",

Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc,. Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.. I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox (locks).. Now let's go.. Take 'em back to the plan.... Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.. Any pessimists I ain't talked to them,. Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.. Let's take 'em back to the club.. Least about an hour I would stand on line,. I just wanted to dance.. I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.. I just wanted to shine.. Jay's favorite line: \"Dog, in due time\". Now he look at me, like \"Damn, dog, you where I am\". A hip hop legend.. I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.. Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la. (Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world). Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la. (Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world). Back when Gucci was the shit to rock,. Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop,. I'd do anything to say \"I got it\".. Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket.. Before anybody wanted K-West beats,. Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC.. Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns,. Like \"Damn, these niggas that much better than me?\". Baby, I'm going on an airplane,. And I don't know if I'll be back again.. Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets,. But when she came to kick it, things became different.. Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on.. I couldn't keep it home, I thought I needed a Nia Long.. I'm trying to write my wrongs,. But it's funny these same wrongs helped me write this song.. Now,. I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly. For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky. (You gonna touch the sky babygirl!) Testify, come up in the spot. Looking extra fly. For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky. Yes, yes, yes guess who's on third?. Lupe steal like Lupin the Third.. Hear like ear till I'm beer on the curb. Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge. Slow it down like we're on the syrup. Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth's.. But, before you say another word,. I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street.. I'm trying to stop lion like a Mum-Ra,. But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.. Engarge, touchÃ© Lupe cool as the unthawed. But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.. I come as correct as a porn star,. In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.. So, I represent the first.. Now, let me end my verse right where the horns are like. (We back at home, baby). Sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. Sky, Sky high. I'm, I'm sky high. Yeah! (Keep it rolling). (Feels good to be home, baby! Feels good to be home!).    \n",

Yeah. . I'm on my way home. . They say home is where the hate is. . My dome is where fate is. . I stroll where souls get lost like vegas. . Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses. . Pray to god that my arms reach the masses. . The young smoke grass in grassless jungles. . Rubberband together in cashless bundles. . We wear struggling chains. . Divided only hustle remains. . Making sense of it we hustle for change. . Revolution ain't a game. . It's another name. . For life fighting. . Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson. . Hypes fighting for hits to heighten they hell. . Don't he know he only get as high as he fell. . Show money becomes bail. . Relationships become jail. . Children are unheld. . I wish love was for sale. . Behold the pale. . Horse got me trapped like r. kel', I bail and it-. . Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again. . I'm on my way home. . I left three days ago. . But no one seems to know I'm gone. . Home is where the hatred is. . Home is filled with pain and it. . Might not be such a bad idea if I never. . Never went home again..    \n",

They see a black man with a white woman at the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong. Middle America packed in, came to see me in my black skin. Number one question they asking. Fuck every question you asking. If I don't get ran out by Catholics, here come some conservative Baptists. Claiming I'm overreacting like them black kids in Chiraq bitch. Four in the morning, and I'm zonin'. They say I'm possessed, it's an omen. I keep it 300, like the Romans. 300 bitches, where's the Trojans?. Baby we livin' in the moment. I've been a menace for the longest. But I ain't finished I'm devoted. And you know it, and you know it. So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down. I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now. But there's nowhere to go, now. And there's no way to slow down. If I knew what I knew in the past. I would have been blacked out on your ass. Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'. They say I'm possessed, it's an omen. I keep it 300, like the Romans. 300 bitches, where's the Trojans?. Baby we livin' in the moment. I've been a menace for the longest. But I ain't finished, I'm devoted. And you know it, and you know it. Stop all that coon shit, early morning cartoon shit. This is that goon shit, fuck up your whole afternoon shit. I'm aware I'm a wolf, soon as the moon hit. I'm aware I'm a king, back out the tomb bitch. Black out the room bitch, stop all that coon shit. These niggas ain't doin' shit, them niggas ain't doin' shit. Come on, homie, what happened?. You niggas ain't breathing you gasping. These niggas ain't ready for action. (Ready, ready for action). Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'. I think I'm possessed, it's an omen. I keep it 300, like the Romans. 300 bitches, where's the Trojans?. Baby we're livin' in the moment. I've been a menace for the longest. But I ain't finished, I'm devoted. And you know it, and you know it. So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down. I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now.

So y'all better quit playing with god. Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you. Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you. The only rapper compared to Michael. So here's a few hating-ass niggas who'll fight you. And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you. And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do. Old niggas mentally still in high school. Since the tight jeans they never liked you. Pink-ass polos with a fucking backpack. But everybody know you brought real rap back. Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack. Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback. Ivan, diamond, Chi-town shining. Monop' in this bitch, get a change of climate. Hop in this bitch and get the same thing I'm in. Until the day I get struck by lightning. I am a god. So hurry up with my damn massage. In a French-ass restaurant. Hurry up with my damn croissants. I am a god. I am a god. I am a god. AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!. AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!. AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!. I just talked to Jesus. He said, \"What up Yeezus?\". I said, \"Shit I'm chilling. Trying to stack these millions.\". I know he the most high. But I am a close high.

Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye. Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye. I'll move my family out the country. So you can't see where I stay. So go and grab the reporters. So I can smash their recorders. See they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order. Meanwhile the DEA. Teamed up with the CCA. They tryna lock niggas up. They tryna make new slaves.

I can hold my liquor. This man can't handle me. But this man can't handle his weed. On Chicago, south of town. I'm on in Indiana. I'm heard on the radio now. I can't handle no liquor. But these bitches can't handle me. I can't control my niggas. And my niggas they can't control me. You say you know me, my nigga. But you really just know the old me. Bitch I'm back out my coma, waking up on your sofa. When I park my Range Rover, slightly scratch your Corolla. Okay, I smashed your Corolla, I'm hanging on a hangover. Five years we been over, ask me why I came over. One more hit and I can own ya, one more fuck and I can own ya. One cold night in October, pussy had me floating. Feel like Deepak Chopra, pussy had me dead. Might call 2Pac over, Yeezy's all on you sofa, these the red Octobers. Still ain't learn me no manners, you love me when I ain't sober. You love me when I'm hungover, even when I blow doja. Then her auntie came over, skinny bitch with no shoulders. Tellin' you that I'm bogus, bitch you don't even know us. Baby girl, he's a loner, baby girl, he's a loner. Late night organ donor, after that he disown ya. After that he's just hopeless, soul mates become soulless. When he's sober it's over and bitch, I'm back out my coma. I can't handle no liquor. But these bitches can't handle me. I can't control my niggas. And my niggas they can't control me. You say you know me, my nigga. But you really just know the old me. I heard you need a new fad. I heard you need a new stack. I heard you need a new phone. I know your 'rents ain't be home. Callin' up your uncle's place. Shit's all over the place. I don't hear your phone. Ohhh on the phone.    \n",

Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas. I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass. Chasin' love, lot of bittersweet hours lost. Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce. Tell your boss you need an extra hour off. Get you super wet after we turn the shower off. That's all them can do (say wah, say wah).

Black girl sippin' white wine. Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign. And grabbed it with a slight grind. And held it 'til the right time. Then she came like AAAAAHHH!. That's why I'm in it and I can't get out (That's all them can do). That's why I'm in it and I can't get out (That's all them can do). Lay it off, it off, it off.. Star fucker,. Star fucker,. Star fucker,. Who? Where?. Time to take it too far now. Michael Douglas out the car now. The kids and the wife life. But can't wake up from the night life. I'm so scared of my demons. I go to sleep with a nightlight. My mind move like a Tron bike. Pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist. I'm gonna start a new movement. Being led by the drums. I'm a rap-lic priest. Getting head by the nuns. They don't play what I'm playing. They don't see what I'm saying. They be balling in the D-League. I be speaking Swaghili.    \n",

I just wanna clear my mind now. It's been racin' since the summertime. And I'm holdin' down the summer now. And all I want is what I can't buy now. Cause I ain't got the money on me right now. And I told you to wait. Yeah I told you to wait. So I'm a need a little more time now. Cause I ain't got the money on me right now. And I thought you could wait. Yeah, I thought you could wait. These bitches surroundin' me. All want somethin' out me. Then they talk about me. Would be lost without me. We could've been somebody. Thought you'd be different 'bout it. Now I know you naughty. So let's get on with it. You could've been somebody. 'Stead you had to tell somebody. Let's take it back to the first party. When you tried your first molly. And came out of your body. And came out of your body. Running naked down the lobby. And you was screamin' that you love me. Before the limelight tore ya. Before the limelight stole ya. Remember we were so young. When I would hold you. Before the glory. I know there ain't wrong with me. Something strange is happening. You could've been somethin'. We could've, we could've been somebody. Or was it all our first party. When we tried our first molly. And came out of our body. And came out of our body. Before they call lawyers. Before you tried to destroy us. How you gon' lie to the lawyers?. It's like I don't even know ya. I gotta bring it back to the 'Nolia. Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas. Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas. Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas. I ride with my niggas, I'll die for my.... To all my second string bitches, trying to get a baby. Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy. I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z. He ain't with you, he with Beyonce, you need to stop actin' lazy. She Instagram herself like \"Bad bitch alert\". He Instagram his watch like \"Mad rich alert\". He only wanna see that ass in reverse. Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse. Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side. Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid. Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died. Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that. Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that. Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that. All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that. That going to that owing money that the court got. On and on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie. 'Til death but do your part, unholy matrimony.    \n",

Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted. Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka. I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba. She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa. On to the next saga. Focus on the future and let the crew knock her. Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca. The one Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka. All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan.

Rockstar bitch call me Elvis. M.O.B, she call me selfish. Success got 'em jealous. Shorty's killing, while I'm drilling. Tattoos, how they break the news. It was real if you made the news. Last night my bitches came in twos. And they both suck like they came to lose. Dropped out the first day of school. Cause niggas got cocaine to move. I be going hard, I got a name to prove. Killing 'em, honey how I make the pain improve. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down. This the greatest shit in the club. Since \"In Da Club\". It's so packed I might ride around. On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club. She say \"Can you get my friends in the club?\". I say \"Can you get my Benz in the club?\". If not, treat your friends like my Benz. Park they ass outside 'til the evening end. When I go raw, I like to leave it in. When I wake up, I like to go again. When I go to work, she gotta call it in. She can't go to work, same clothes again. And her heart colder than the souls of men. Louboutin on the toes again. Tight dress dancing close to him. Yeezus just rose again. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down. We can send this bitch up, it can't go down. Memories don't live like people do. They always 'member you. Whether things are good or bad. It's just the memories that you have.    \n",

Bound to fall in love. Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey). All them other niggas lame, and you know it now. When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown. Bound. Bound to fall in love. Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey). What you doing in the club on a Thursday?. She say she only here for her girl birthday. They ordered champagne but still look thirsty. Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty. I know I got a bad reputation. Walking 'round, always mad reputation. Leave a pretty girl sad reputation. Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation. I turned the nightclub out of the basement. I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining. How you gon' be mad on vacation?. Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans. Uh, this that prom shit. This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit. This that red cup, all on the lawn shit. Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch. I know you're tired of loving, of loving. With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey). Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures. One good girl is worth a thousand bitches. Bound. Bound to fall in love. Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey). I wanna fuck you hard on the sink. After that, give you something to drink. Step back, can't get spunk on the mink. I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?. Hey, you remember where we first met?. Okay, I don't remember where we first met. But hey, admitting is the first step. And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect. And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep. But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect. And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving. So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas. She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist. Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?. Maybe we could still make it to the church steps. But first, you gon' remember how to forget. After all these long-ass verses. I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept. I know you're tired of loving, of loving. With nobody to love, nobody, nobody. So just grab somebody, no leaving this party. With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey). Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth. Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth. Bound. Bound to fall in love. Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey).    \n",

Hallelujah, God . Yes, God. We don't want no devils in the house, God . Yes, Lord. We want the lord . Yes, Jesus. And that's it . Yes, God. Hallelâ hand over Satan . Yes, Jesus. Jesus praise the Lord . Yes, God. I'm tryna keep my faith. We on an ultralight beam. We on an ultralight beam. This is a God dream. This is a God dream. This is everything. This is everything. Deliver us serenity. Deliver us peace. Deliver us loving. We know we need it. You know we need it. You know we need it. That's why we need you now, oh,. I pray for Paris. Pray for the parents. This is a God dream. This is a God dream. This is a God dream. We on an ultralight beam. We on an ultralight beam. This is a God dream. This is a God dream. This is everything. Everything, thing, thing, thing. I'm tryna keep my faith. But I'm looking for more. Somewhere I can feel safe. And end my holy war. I'm tryna keep my faith. So why send depression not blessings?. Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? More. You persecute the weak. Because it makes you feel so strong to save. Don't have much strength to fight. So I look to the light, Lord. To make these wrongs turn right. Head up high, I look to the light. Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright. And I know that you'll take good care of your child. Oh, no longer am afraid of the night. Cause I, I look to the light. When they come for you, I will shield your name. I will field their questions, I will feel your pain. No one can judge. They don't, they don't know. They don't know. Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea. I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia. Treat the demons just like Pam. I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina. I been this way since Arthur was anteater. Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap the bam. Tryna snap photos of familia. My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her. You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille. Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail. I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell. I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail. He said let's do a good ass job with Chance three. I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy. Let's make it so free and the bars so hard. That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet. This is my part, nobody else speak. This is my part, nobody else speak. This little light of mine. Glory be to God, yeah. I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go. If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats. Know what God said when he made the first rainbow. Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro. Ugh, I'm just having fun with it. You know that a nigga was lost. I laugh in my head. Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt. Ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike. You cannot mess with the light. Look at lil Chano from 79th. We on an ultralight beam. We on an ultralight beam. This is a God dream. This is a God dream. This is everything. Everything. Yes, God. Hallelujah. I'm tryna keep my faith. Yes, Jesus. That's it. But I'm looking for more. Somewhere I can feel safe. And end my holy war. Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough.. This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up.. For everyone that feels they've said \"I'm sorry\" too many times.. You can never go too far when you can't come back home again. That's why I need.... Faith, more, safe, war.    \n",

You want me to give you a testimony about my life, and how good he's been to me.. I don't know what to tell you about him,. I love him so much with all my heart and my soul with every bone in my body I love him so much because he's done so much for me. . Every morning, every day of my life.. I won't always be crying tears in the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up by myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day.. I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it, how I'm gonna get there, because he.... he's gonna be there for me. Some day the sky above will open up and he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will.. I won't always be crying these tears. I won't always be feeling so blue. Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name.. Some day he will. I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like..

I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye. Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye. I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye. The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye. I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye. I gotta to say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye. See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes. And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes. I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye. I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Kanye. What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?. Called \"I Miss The Old Kanye,\" man that'd be so Kanye. That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye. And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye.    \n",

I been waiting for a minute. For my lady. So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes. I been living without limits. As far as my business. I'm the only one that's in control. I been feeling all I've given. For my children. I will die for those I love. God, I'm willing. To make this my mission. Give up the women. Before I lose half of what I own. I been thinking. About my vision. Pour out my feelings. Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul. The layers to my soul. Revealing the layers to my soul. They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up. Can't let them get to me. And even though I always fuck my life up. Only I can mention me. See, before I let you go. One last thing I need to let you know. You ain't never seen nothing crazier than. This nigga when he off his Lexapro. Remember that last time in Mexico. Remember that last time, the episode. Asking me why the hell I text in code. Four times that you say don't text me hoe. Told you four times, don't test me, hoe. Now we finna lose all self-control. But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me. Especially when we in the Giuseppe store. But I'mma have the last laugh in the end. Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe. Yeah, I'mma have the laugh in the end. Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe. And I.... They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up. Can't let them get to me. And even though I always fuck my life up. Only I can mention me. They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up. Can't let them get to me. And even though I always fuck my life up. Only I can mention me. See through the veil. And forget all of your cares. Throw them, throw them away. Don't stop your loving. Don't stop for nothing. No, not for nothing. They don't wanna see me love you. Nah, don't stop it. They always love it. They always wanna. They don't wanna see me love you. They don't wanna see me love you. They don't wanna see me love you. They don't wanna see me love you. See through the veil. And forget all your cares. Throw them, throw them away. Oh, life's a feeling. Oh, the body's a feeling.    \n",

Real friends, how many of us?. How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends. It's not many of us, we smile at each other. But how many honest? Trust issues. Switched up the number, I can't be bothered. I cannot blame you for havin' an angle. I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing. Hope you're doin' your thing too. I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions. Fuck the church up, I'm drinkin' at the communion. Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined. In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?. Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom. I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you're not the problem. Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday. Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?. When was the last time I remembered a birthday?. When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?. Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime. Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime. Even when we was young I used to make time. Now we be way too busy just to make time. Even for my.... Real friends. I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?. Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him. I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?. Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him. I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was. Couldn't tell you how old your son is. I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg. Plus I already got one kid. Couldn't tell you much about the fam though. I just showed up for the yams though. Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister. Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business. You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?. Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with. Please don't pressure me with that bill shit. Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children. Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me. Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me. It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries. To be honest, dawg I ain't feelin' your energy. Money turn your kin into an enemy. Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be. Lookin' for all my real friends. How many of us? How many of us are real friends. To real friends, to the real end. 'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin. To 3 A.M., callin'. How many real friends?. Just to ask you a question. Just to see how you was feelin'. How many?. For the last you was frontin'. I hate when a nigga text you like, \"what's up, fam, oh you good?\". You say, \"I'm good\" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'. How many?. What's best for your family, immediate or extended. Any argument, the media'll extend it. I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on. Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him. Real friends. Huh?. Real friends. I guess I get what I deserve, don't I. Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him. I guess I get what I deserve, don't I. Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him.    \n",

You too wild, you too wild. You too wild, I need you now. Got to love you. Found you, found you. Right now, right now. Right now, right now. If your mama knew how. You turned out, you too wild. You too wild, you too wild. You too wild, and I need you now. Lost and found now. You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph. Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip. Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip. We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this. Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'. I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo. I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow. I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow. I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow. I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow. I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow. I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow. You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage. You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich. I said baby what if you was clubbin'. Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?. Then I said, \"What if Mary was in the club. When she met Joseph around hella thugs?. Cover Nori in lambs' wool.

Baby lion goes. Where the islands go. You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone. Million dollar renovations to a happy home. My ex says she gave me the best years of her life. I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right. I wake up, assessin' the damages. Checkin' MediaTakeOut. Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch. But it's blurry enough to get the fake out. I wake up, all veggies no eggs. I hit the gym, all chest no legs. Yep, then I made myself a smoothie. Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie. Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago. Ãndale Ãndale E.I, E.I, uh, oh. You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone. You was the best of all time at the time though. Yeah, you wasn't mine though. But I still drove 30 hours. But still drove 30 hours to you. I remember rapping for Jay and Cam. Young producer just trying to get his flows off. I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret. 'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off. Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition. I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December. Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women. Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl. You don't love me, you just pretendin'. I need that happy beginnin', middle and endin'. Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago. It's gettin' hot in hurr, that's all that I know. Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you. You call down for an omelet. Girl it's 5 in the morning. You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria. Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me. I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob. Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs. But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time. Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job. And I drove back 30 hours. Were remains that long to lose sad. Better unsaid. Always turn, oh. 3 stacks, can you help me out?. 30 hours. Yeah, this the type of shit you ride out to. 30 hours. 30 hours. I just be like, it was my idea to have an open relationship. Now a nigga mad. Now I'm 'bout to drive 90 miles like Matt Barnes to kill.... 30 hours. Just to kill... Just to.... Just to....

Had to put the flyest nigga on this shit. The pyramids shall rise. 30 hours. Look at all these Ultralight Beams flowin'. For all the moms, dads, the kids, the families that shared this moment with us. Let's rock out for 'bout. 30 hours. You know, ay you know. Ay, you know, ay, you know. 30 hours.

       "137  . . . . . La di da di da, da. I like this flavor. La di da di da, la. Let me tell you. I'm out here from a very far away place. All for a chance to be a star. Nowhere seems to be too far. No more parties in LA. Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh. No more parties in LA. Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh. No more (Los Angeles). Please (shake that body, party that bod-). Please (shake that body, party that body). Please (shake that body, party that body). Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans. And my sheets still orange from your spray tan. It was more than soft porn for the K-man. She remember my Sprinter, said \"I was in the grape van\". Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty. Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie. Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler. I show you the ropes, connect the dots. A country girl that love Hollywood. Mama used to cook red beans and rice. Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite. Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection. Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians. R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers. Music and iPhone cameras. This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, one thing. That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean. He flew you in this motherfucker on first class. Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag. Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?. That shit don't add up, you're making them mad as fuck. She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper. I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards. You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence. Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is. The head still good though, the head still good though. Ladies say \"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo\". Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical. Make me get spiritual. Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal. Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me. Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday. Bottle service, head service, I came in first place. The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek. The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee. And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets. Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity. And yeah G, I was all for it. She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet. I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie. Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy. Scary. Scary. No more parties in LA. Please, baby, no more parties in LA. Friday night tryna make it into the city. Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty. Thinking back to how I got here in the first place. Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base. A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds. And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs. Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous. When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list. Strippers get invited to where they only get hired. When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired. I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired. And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir. Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary. I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries. For all my niggas with babies by bitches. That use their kids as meal tickets. Not knowing the disconnect from the father. The next generation will be the real victims. I can't fault 'em really. I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly. Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'. Of weak content of slow jammin'. But don't worry, this one's so jammin'. You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'. I be thinkin' every day. Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades. I be paranoid every time. The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'. The problem is I be textin'. My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired. First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died. Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive. That's why I'd rather take the 405. I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim. But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him. I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents. What I'm supposed to do?. Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?. Every agent I know know I hate agents. I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant. Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance. It's just me, I do it my way, bitch. Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans. If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans. I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again. But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans. I'm 38 years old, a 8 year old with rich nigga problems. Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I ain't never drive it. It took 6 months to take the Maybach all matted out. And my assistant crashed as soon as they backed it out. God...   \n",

(Perfect!). Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman. Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman. (Yo!). Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished. I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers. Herzog and Adidas, man you know they love it. If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!. If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!. But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, \"Get your money\". Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days. Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away. I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon. I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!). Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive. I was out here spazzin', all y'all get the message?. On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham. 2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!. I've been trending years, y'all a couple days. Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised. Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves. Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (Yo!). 10 thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (Yo!). Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (Yo!). I done wore designers I won't wear again. Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant. Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!. Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman. (Sonic boom!). Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury. I give 'em grey poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!. If you ain't poppin' shit then why you rap for? Haaan?. Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!. And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute. (We did). Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!. Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?. Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (Yo!). Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (Yo!). I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!). Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion. James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!). Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house. I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse. Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo. Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel. Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?. I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!). Every time I see the news, man it bring me home. Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone. We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?. So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2. Timbuck2, Timbuck2. Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are. (Perfect!).    \n",

       "140  . . . . . Yeah, 9: 08 L.A. time. Back in the lab and shit. My wife said, I can't say no to nobody. And at this rate we gon' both die broke. Got friends that ask me for money knowing I'm in debt. And like my wife said, I still didn't say no. People tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter. My friends best advice was to stay low. I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills. Especially when you got family members on payroll. The media said it was outlandish spending. The media said he's way out of control. I just feel like I'm the only one not pretending. I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control. I know I'm the most influential. That TIME cover was just confirmation. This generation's closest thing to Einstein. So don't worry about me, I'm fine. I can see a thousand years from now in real life. Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like. Grow conventional thought, don't need to question. I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive. Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission. Did it with no permission, on our own conditions. Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission. Yeezy with the big house, did it way different. Never listen to Hollywood producers. Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa. The ultimate Gemini has survived. I wasn't supposed to make it past 25. And you're looking at the church in the night sky. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. Are we looking in the church in the night sky. And you wonder where is God in your nightlife. Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky. Father, father, father. Wondering whether God's gonna say hi. The night sky, I feel like I'm home, baby. I've been waking the spirits of millions more to come. A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums. I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro. If the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho. Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation. He sat back and smiled. Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime. The Jews share they truth on how to make a dime. Most black men couldn't balance a cheque-book. But buy a new car, talking 'bout how my neck look?. Well it all looks great. Four hundred years later, we buying our own chains. The light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard. Real family stick together and see through the mirage. The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality. Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?. I am one with the people. I am one with the people, real. I've awoken from an enlightened man's dream. Checking Instagram comments to crowd-source my self-esteem. Let me not say too much or do too much. Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch. I'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen. So the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping. God, I have humbled myself before the court. Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort. I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams. One set of footsteps, you was carrying me. When I turned on the news and they was burying me. One set of footsteps, you was carrying me. When I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me. Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see. I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov. I heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove. But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks. Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'mma never go broke. Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go. We all go. Not just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo. She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo. Modern day MJ with an off-the-wall flow. Nightlife, walk all over me. Walk all over me. I'm delivering everything I've ever sent to you, bring. Fly, fly, fly overseas. Fly overseas.
